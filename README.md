**DevPath** is an interactive, visually-driven platform that allows users to explore educational or skill-development roadmaps. Through connected nodes and edges, users can navigate different stages of a roadmap, each packed with resources like articles, videos, and documents. This project is built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for visualizing node-based roadmaps and [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) for managing and fetching data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Roadmap Display**: Visualize roadmap structures as connected nodes and edges.
- **Resource Integration**: Access resources (articles, videos, documents) associated with each roadmap node.
- **Dynamic Fetching**: Fetch and display roadmaps dynamically based on user selection.
- **Resource Accessibility**: Seamlessly link to resources for further learning.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, React Flow, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Appwrite (for data management and API)
