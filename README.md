# [ DevPath üó∫Ô∏è](https://devpath.netlify.app)

**DevPath** is an interactive, visually-driven platform that allows users to explore educational or skill-development roadmaps. Through connected nodes and edges, users can navigate different stages of a roadmap, each packed with resources like articles, videos, and documents. This project is built with React Flow for visualizing node-based roadmaps and Appwrite for managing and fetching data.
