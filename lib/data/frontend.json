Other systems include Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial. VCS enables features like branching for parallel development, merging to combine changes, and reverting to previous states. They facilitate collaboration through remote repositories, pull requests, and code reviews. VCS also provides backup and recovery capabilities, conflict resolution, and the ability to tag specific points in history. By maintaining a detailed record of changes and supporting non-linear development, VCS has become an essential tool in modern software development, enhancing productivity, code quality, and team collaboration.\n\n",
